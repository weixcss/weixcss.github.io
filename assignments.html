          <p>
            Collecting dataset with elevator arrival times on the ground floor
            in CDS. Using this dataset, we will determine the best location to
            wait in order to minimize the expected walking distance to the next
            arriving elevator.

          </h3>
          <p>
            This assignment involves loading the MNIST dataset to normalize it.
            Performed SVD and reduced the dimensions of the data. Trained a
            logistic regression model on the original and SVD-reduced data.
            Measured and compared the training time and accuracy of the model
            with varying SVD components. Results shown in a plot with analysis
            on how SVD impacts the performance and efficiency of the model.

          <p>
            Interactive web application that implements a basic search engine
            using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search engine will take a

          <p>
            Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to
            predict customer churn for a bank. Goal is to identify customers who
            are likely to leave the bank based on historical data and submitted
            predictions in a mini Kaggle competition.

          <h3>Midterm 1: Data Science Competition</h3>
          <p>
            Our project predicts Amazon movie review scores using machine
            learning models, focusing on feature engineering from review
            metadata, text length, and sentiment analysis. Using K-Nearest
            Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with balanced class
            weights, we optimize for accuracy through key features and model
            tuning, aiming for effective review score predictions.

          <h3>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h3>
          <p>
            Exploration: Impact of changing parameters on linear regression. The
            goal is to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how
            modifying these parameters affects regression results, especially
            when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking
            these settings, we'll observe how randomness can influence the slope
            and intercept in a regression model.

            Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear
            Regression
          </h3>
          <p>
            Exploration: This assignment extends the previous linear regression
            project by adding hypothesis testing and confidence interval
            calculations. By experimenting with different values for parameters
            and confidence levels, users can explore how randomness affects
            statistical inference in regression models. This exercise provides
            hands-on experience with hypothesis testing, confidence intervals,
            and statistical interpretation in a linear regression context..

          <p>
            Analysis of a simple neural network by visualizing its learned
            features, decision boundary, and gradients. The goal is to develop a
            deeper understanding of how a Feedforward Neural Network with one
            hidden layer operates and represents the input space during
            learning.

          <p>
            In this assignment, we implemented a simplified version of Google
            Image Search using a Flask web application. The application allows
            users to perform three types of searches—Image query, Text query,
            and Hybrid query—on a dataset of images, using CLIP embeddings for
            similarity computation.
